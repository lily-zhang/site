This semester, which will be my last full semester, I took an iOS development course as an upper-level elective. Our first few projects included recreating 2048, then building on the same app. For our semester group project, we chose to do an audio editor that lets you create recordings and subject them to interesting sound effects.

From the startup page, select a recording to enter editor mode. Can modify pitch and tempo, add effects, or introduce another track on top of your own from the library of overlays.

Crowd favorites included <i>Plastic Love</i> and the theme from <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.

Lastly, you can publish your finished track to a public library to share with the greater population.

Bonus: the app in its early stages of development!
