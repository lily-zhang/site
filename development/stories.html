<i>Fall 2018</i>

<br><br>

For my database design course, our semester project was to create a news reader mobile application that lets users reader news items, or "stories," that are published near their location. We created an Android app that communicated with a Firebase database.

Reader home page, where you are directed after signing in. Here, you can see articles that are relevant to your profile in three ways: (1) you subscribed to the broader category that the article belongs to (such as "politics" or "technology"); (2) the article was tagged with a location that matches one of your own; (3) the article was published within the last few days.

Reading an article

The "publisher's side" is a website that lets publishers issue articles and create categories. The app will ding with a notification in real time when a new article is published.
