<i>Fall 2018</i>

<br><br>

For my database design course, our semester project was to create a "stories" or news reader mobile application that lets users subscribe to news items, or "stories," that are published within a certain radius of their location. It was a lot of work over three weeks, but we finished with a complete, functional app. We created an Android app that communicated with a Firebase database.

Reader home page, where you are directed after signing in. Here, you can view the articles that are relevant to your profile in three ways: (1) you subscribed to the article's category; (2) the article was tagged with a location that is within a certain radius of one of your own specified locations; (3) the article was published within the "still relevant" time frame.

User menu - "Post Archive" contains stories that you received at some time in the past, but which passed out of the "still relevant" time frame.

The "publisher's side" is a website that lets publishers issue new articles and create categories. Some other features of the app include: notifications (when an article that's relevant for you comes out); user registration and login support.
