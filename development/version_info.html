<i>September 2019</i>

<br><br>

I started my first job as a software developer in August, where I've mostly been writing bug fixes for an ASP.NET web application. My first UI task was to create a way of indicating to users when a new version of the site is released, and a way for the site admin to write up whatever new features or fixes were added.

This version subheader, next to the main site logo, used to be simple text. Now, upon a new release, it gets some extra visual emphasis. It's also a link that opens an Updates dialog, which is exactly what it sounds like.
