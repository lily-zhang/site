<i>September 2019</i>

<br><br>

I started a job as a software developer in August. My first UI-centric task was to create a way of indicating to users when a new version of the site has been released.

This version subheader, next to the main site logo, used to be simple text. Now, upon a new release, it gets some extra visual emphasis. It links to an Updates dialog, where users can read about what's been added.
