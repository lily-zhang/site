<i>April 2020</i>

Back in September, I created a new feature on the ASP.NET site that lets you watch, or subscribe to, records. For some context, the site's purpose is to create records and move them through a complex, multi-step process where different users must contribute to or review the record at each stage. The subscription feature is accessible on individual record pages, queues, and search results where many records are tabulated together. As a follow-up task, I designed a central location for users to view their watch items.

This dashboard, located on the site's home page, displays a summary of your watch items in a small, concise table. I used the <a href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank">DataTables</a> plugin, so you can sort and filter as well.
