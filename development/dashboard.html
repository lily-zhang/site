Back in September, I implemented a feature that lets you subscribe to records. For some context, the site is used to create records and move them through a complex, multi-step process where different users must contribute to or review the record at each stage. The subscription feature is accessible from individual record pages and search results where records are tabulated together. As a follow-up task, I designed a central location for users to view their watch items.

This dashboard, located on the home page, displays a summary of your watch items in a small, concise table. Users are able to sort and filter on record fields.
